# [Welcome to Terra A.D.]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/Welcome_to_Terra_AD.html) Meat Grinder Documents

A resource for Meat Grinder Tabletop players playing in Mutant Crawl Classics. Some of this is paraphrased from the MCC rulebook, and some of this is work of my own. I'm expanding their system's campaign setting and will include only stats that are original. My goal here is not to plagiarize, but to expand upon, so I will also give credit to [the system (Mutant Crawl Classics) and Goodman Games](https://goodman-games.com/store/product/mutant-crawl-classics-role-playing-game-2/). It's really cool if you're into old school table top role playing, and definitely worth the price tag. This information and campaign setting will remain free for the course of it's lifetime.
