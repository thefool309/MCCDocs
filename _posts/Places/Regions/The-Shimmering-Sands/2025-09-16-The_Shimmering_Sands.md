A desert with an extremely high level of magic permeating in the sands. It's said it glows almost a faint green at night time. Said to be the center of [The Great Collapse](Introduction/Welcome to Terra AD#The Great Collapse) though this is mostly unconfirmed tribal myths. There is a lot of danger, and a lot of artifacts to be found in a place such as this. It is rumored that there is a slumbering artifact of the kind that caused The Great Collapse here. Somewhere the answers to the question "what caused the disaster?" are waiting for a brave soul capable of deciphering its secrets to uncover the truth of what happened.

## Ecology

The daytime Heat here can be unbearable, and the nights tend to get very frigid. With serious temperature fluctuations so you may want to plan accordingly. Occasionally the "Magic Dust Storm" will occur, creating almost a green glow effect in the air, but also making it incredibly difficult to breath and see. There are various Ruins of Civilization scattered throughout this desert, and some seekers who have ventured into the desert have returned with knowledge of a great desert tribe that had control of all the affairs in the desert. 

The water here is sparse forcing many of the animals such as rodents, reptiles, and insects to have evolved to survive extreme temperatures and scarce water. Plants like cacti and succulents have adapted to conserve water, and fungi have formed symbiotic relationships with these plants to survive. Natural water sources are very rare, often found in oases and underground aquifers. Some areas are rumored to contain springs with magical healing properties.
