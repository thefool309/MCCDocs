The setting of Terra A.D. is mostly covered by rain forest, also known as The Xocust Wilderness. These are the lands known to the tribes to be the most forgiving. There are exceptions to this rule but a rain forest biome is expected across most of Terra A.D. Those of the tribal societies don't know anything beyond the wilderness aside from rumors brought in from the various seeker. As the world has attempted to repair itself the canopies of the rain forest have expanded creating The Xocust Wilderness.
## Ecology

With the rain forest spanning vast regions, there is a continuous canopy over large portions of the world. The climate is warm and humid with consistent rainfall throughout the year. The fauna compose of trees that stand over 600 feet, and the many mutated animals and plants that resulted from [The Great Collapse](2025-09-16-Welcome_to_Terra_AD.md). For reference [the tallest known living tropical tree is 320 ft tall.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menara_(tree)) There are legends of a giant tree that rules over the deepest and thickest parts of the jungle.

There are many variations of Manimals and Plantients here, so your imagination is kind of the limit. Any animal or plant you could imagine in the rain forest is a possible encounter. Mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects of all kind litter the floor of this rain forest. Plants have adapted to the high humidity and competition for light. Large leaves, climbing vines and epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants) are common.
