The glow is thought to be a remnant of advanced technology from the pre-apocalyptic era. It may have originated from nuclear energy, cosmic effects, or ancient artifacts that harnessed energy in ways now forgotten. Legends now speak of The Glow as a celestial gift, a beacon of transformation and change that emerged after the world was ravaged by catastrophe. It symbolizes the potential for rebirth and renewal. 

While some tribes view the belief in The Glow as dangerous or misguided, [The Children of The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Children_of_The_Glow.html) see it as a path to transformation into one's true self. The Glow is often associated with various myths and legends throughout tribes which has in part created tribes like [The Children of The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Children_of_The_Glow.html). There are whispers and rumors of cults dedicated to harness it's power in [The Shimmering Sands]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Shimmering_Sands.html).

The Glow has become a huge cultural impact on all the various Archaic Alignments (tribes). Many tribes revere but also fear The Glow. Some tribes believe it is a dark curse placed on the land by the magic of [The Ancient Ones]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Ancient_Ones.html).
