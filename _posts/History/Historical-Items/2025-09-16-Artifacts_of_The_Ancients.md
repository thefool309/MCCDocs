The Artifacts of [The Ancients]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Ancient_Ones.html) were created for a variety of reasons. From dangerous weapons like the Lazer Rifle to mundane things like multitools and scanners, the Artifacts of The Ancients are any piece of technology that the denizens of these lands can't completely understand. What the tribes attribute to magic, you or I may attribute to science or technology. In practice it doesn't particularly matter what the source of these powerful artifacts is, just that they can be greatly effect the power and level of control of whatever tribes control them.

There are many magic weapons that are scattered throughout the various ruins of [The Ancient Ones]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Ancient_Ones.html)
