## A Brief Overview
Terra A.D. is a primitive world dominated by the bizarre side-effects of an Ancient Apocalypse, known only as The Great Collapse. Millennia after this cataclysmic extinction event, the planet has transformed into a lush tropical wilderness, now referred to as **Terra A.D.** (After Disaster). Plants and animals with unstable and strange mutations permeate the ecosystem and the food chain. 

Of these mutations, the strangest and most pervasive is the advent of sentience and intelligence. Never before in the history of Terra A.D. have so many intelligent species been competing for their place in the ecosystem. There are many sentient plants and animals that have developed enough intelligence and sentience to be able to use tools and engage communally. Many are walking upright and have developed various levels of reasoning abilities. These two species are referred to as Manimals, and Plantients.

The few members of mankind left descended into barbarism and savagery. They eventually split into two separate species: Pure Strain Humans (PSH) and Mutants. Pure Strain Humans survived not through virtue of constantly mutating genetics, but through a genome that is hardened against radiation and other mutagenic environmental effect. This has left Pure Strain Humans as an especially intelligent and hardy race. 

Mutants survived through taking advantage of the beneficial mutations and using them to give them a leg up in tribal society. Natural Selection awarded their ancestors for possessing an either very plastic and unstable, or very hardy genome.
## [The Great Collapse]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Great_Collapse.html)
The Great Collapse (A.K.A. The Great Disaster) is when [[2025-09-16-The_Ancient_Ones]]' society collapsed from their own hubris. In their great intelligence, they created massive empires with ancient magics, but in a lack of wisdom, much of this advancement was done in magical weapons. Eventually creating something that was capable of ending the world backfired, and ended the world. The exact cause of this is unknown to the vast majority of the world, and anyone who does know is not eager to share the information. 
## Ecology and Climate
The world of Terra AD is that of a tropical hothouse and rain forest, referred to as [The Xocust Wilderness]({{ site.baseurl }}2025/09/16/The_Ancient_Ones.html). It is said it assumes this climate from pole to pole. The sun is red and bloated, and the skies are an emerald-blue green. Dense jungles and mile-tall trees dominate the planet. This place is still struggling to recover Fully from the disaster even after many millennia. The planet seems to have chosen to do so by undergoing an explosive evolutionary radiation of it's native life forms. Where there is life there is an overabundance of it. Mega-fauna are the rule rather than the exception.

The weather composes of large amounts of rain, and thunderstorms. There are places in the world (Like [The Shimmering Sands]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Shimmering_Sands.html)) that have climates that deviate from this due to other influences however. Sometimes these influences are apparent and in others they are not.
