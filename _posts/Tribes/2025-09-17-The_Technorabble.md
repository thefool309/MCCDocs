The Technorabble are a wild, anarchic society of artifact groupies and AI hackers. They are secretive and clannish by nature, as most tribal societies consider them akin to black sorcerers. Technorabble enclaves tend to be located in remote areas with easy access to one or more AI installations, which will be under their control. The Technorabble are expert at recovering and mastering robots, holograms, and AIs, and typically use such AIs to both protect themselves and to comb ruins for even more recoverable technology and robots. Among their highest ranks are the dreaded Technomancers, whose merest appearance has been known to send entire tribes of armed sentients running in the other direction.
