Open only to pure strain humans (or those mutants who can pass for pure strain human), the Gene Police are an ancient and savage secret society bent upon eliminating all mutations from the face of Terra A.D. Highly clandestine by nature, their members are often found working undercover among more enlightened peoples and tribes, always seeking to tip the balance of power in favor of pure strain humans. No tactics are too underhanded, no lie too foul, no plan too brutal, if a member of the Gene Police thinks that such actions will result in the suffering or death of a mutant, manimal, or plantient. With sufficient time and resources, the Gene Police are capable of slowly taking over a tribal village, turning it into a Gene Police enclave populated only by pure strain humans. 

**Qualifications:** Membership is normally limited to NPC pure strain human characters. 

**Benefits:** None. Membership in this Archaic Alignment is normally only open to NPCs. 

**Secret Sign:** A mimed dagger thrust into the open palm of the opposite hand, rotating the ersatz blade 90 degrees.
