The Holy Medicinal Order is a monastic order comprised of all genotypes. While their members maintain a series of remote monasteries (which are universally acknowledged by all genotypes and archaic alignments as neutral combatfree zones), they are most commonly known by the subsect of their order that chooses to wander the wilderness of Terra A.D., rendering aid to any who seek it. Among most sentients, it is considered a blessed sign of the highest order to receive a visit from or encounter with a Holy Medicinal Order monk. 

**Qualifications:** Membership is normally limited to NPC characters. A PC of any genotype may join, but must forswear to forever give up all martial arts and combat, under pain of excommunication from the order. 

**Benefits:** Members are universally treated as non-combatants by virtually all sentients living in Terra A.D. Bringing any harm to a monk of The Holy Medicinal order is considered a great taboo and an unforgivable sin. 

**Secret Sign:** Both hands clasped together palm inwards with fingers interlocked.
