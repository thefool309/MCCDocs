Open to all plantients, and to select members of other genotypes, The Atomic Equinox is a stoic society of plantients that believe all animal life (including sentients) are primarily useful as a necessary and ongoing source of carbon-dioxide. While not hostile by nature, members of The Atomic Equinox will not hesitate to react with force to any perceived harm to plant life in general or to the ecosystem as a whole. The Atomic Equinox sometimes allow members of other genotypes to join as special “Warders” to assist them with their primary task of care-taking the natural environment. This archaic alignment is sometimes referred to by outsiders as “the tree-huggers who hug back.”

Commonly considered "druids" or "natures protectors" this tribe is not looked upon with any malice, and is highly revered, by other mutant tribes. Seen as keepers of peace and balance, they walk the lands of [The Xocust Wilderness]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Xocust_Wilderness.html) punishing those who disrespect it's fauna and flora. Their one and only goal is to take care of nature and let the planet heal from [The Great Collapse]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Great_Collapse.html).

**Qualifications:** Membership is open to any like-believing plantient, and to select pure strain humans, mutants, and manimals who may serve the greater good. 

**Benefits:** Members cannot become lost in any wilderness area containing plants; members are likewise readily able to locate sources of fresh water. 

**Secret Sign:** Both hands or prehensile appendages brought together cupped with fingers spread, to form the shape of a flower.
