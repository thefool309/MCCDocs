Open to mutants, manimals, and plantients, but primarily composed of mutants, the Children of the Glow worship radiation as the divine personification of Fate. Members of this Archaic Alignment consider "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)" to be the "Great Changer of Life." They revere the influence and judgments of "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)" and respect it as the holy will of the universe. 

They see granting and taking away mutations as "blessings" and "curses" of "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)." They also do not use or tolerate the use of the term "defect." They believe all mutations are granted as a gift from "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)", and as a divine gift, should be treated as such. They see all mutations as a benefit, even if the benefit is not completely understood. 

Many other archaic alignments will deal with this one, but most of them are wary when dealing with the pious and zealous members of this tribe. Their devotion to their beliefs is unwavering, and intimidating to other tribes, who tend to be wary of the ill effects of exposure to "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)." Many choose to deal in great caution when interacting with The Children, as the slightest insult to their beliefs can bring on their wrath, and at best they will stop trading with the tribe.

Status within this Archaic Alignment (Tribe) are based upon the number of mutations carried by an individual. The more numerous and strange the mutations, the higher one's rank is. 

**Qualifications:** Membership is granted to like-minded mutants, manimals and plantients. Applicants must undergo an initiation where they spend a week in a known radioactive area, and permitted they survive the experience, they will have proven their dedication to "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)."

**Benefits:** Members add a +5 to all mutation check rolls, or when gaining a new passive mutation or defect. 

**Secret Sign:** Hands clasped in opposite facing directions and held against the chest followed by a short bow. This refers to another member being in "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)."
