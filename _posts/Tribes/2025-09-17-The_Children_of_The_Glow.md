Open to mutants, manimals, and plantients, but primarily composed of mutants, the Children of the Glow worship radiation as the divine personification of Fate. Members of this Archaic Alignment consider "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)" to be the "Great Changer of Life." They revere the influence and judgments of "[The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html)" and respect it as the holy will of the universe. 

They see granting and taking away mutations as "blessings" and "curses" of [The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html). They also do not use or tolerate the use of the term "defect." They believe all mutations are granted as a gift from [The Glow]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/17/The_Glow.html), and as a divine gift, should be treated as such. They see all mutations as a benefit, even if the benefit is not completely understood. 

Status within this Archaic Alignment (Tribe) are based upon the number of mutations carried by an individual. The more numerous and strange the mutations, the higher one's rank is.
