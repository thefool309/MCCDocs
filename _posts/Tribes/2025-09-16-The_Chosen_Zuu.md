The core belief of The Chosen Zuu is that humanity may no longer be top of the food chain, but they are still owed respect, like an elderly parent. This sentiment is based on a long standing oral tradition that they owe their very existence to an [Ancient One](History/Historical-Factions/The Ancient Ones.md) named Doctor Thadeus Hanhuman, creator of the holy substance known as Cortexin. Is is said that prior to [The Great Collapse]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/The_Great_Collapse.html), Dr. Hanhuman lived in the fabled land of Washington Zuu. There he gave the animals the Cortexin elixir, which enabled them to stand upright and to speak. 

The Chosen Zuu embody a blend of respect for their origins, a commitment to cooperation, and a readiness to defend their beliefs.
