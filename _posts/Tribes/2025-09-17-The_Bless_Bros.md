While The Blessed Brotherhood, or as it is more commonly known, The Vile Brotherhood, is technically open to all mutants, this group of would-be world conquerors is dominated and governed by an elite priesthood of mutants with superior mental mutations. A thoroughly evil and decadent cult, the Brotherhood is bent on nothing less than world domination, and to that end they are often among those found exploring and looting ancient ruins, seeking any means of achieving greater military power. 

**Qualifications:** Membership is normally limited to NPC mutant characters. 

**Benefits:** None. Membership in this Archaic Alignment is normally only open to NPCs. 

**Secret Sign:** The first two fingers of the right hand touching the temple combined with a slight nod of the head.
