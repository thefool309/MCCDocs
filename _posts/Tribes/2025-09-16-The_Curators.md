Dominated by pure strain humans, but open to mutants and manimals, The Curators revere and worship all forms of ancient technology. The group is divided into two main sub-groups: the more orthodox Curators known as Conservators, and the far more open and liberal thinking Traders. Conservators believe that anything from the smallest trinkets to the most complex machines is a holy object to be kept and at least displayed. The Traders sect act as a more practical barter-based merchant class in most tribes and villages. They commonly trade in trinkets (small, otherwise worthless pieces of duralloy, plasteel, and permaglass) and much more rarely deal in functioning [The Artifacts of The Ancients]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/09/16/Artifacts_of_The_Ancients.html)
